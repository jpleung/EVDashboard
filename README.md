# EV Dashboard

This project aimed at looking at how the adoption of electric vehicles has changed over time. The data set used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noureddineridanr96/electric-vehicle-population-data/data

The first portion of this project was done using SQL. Exploratory data analysis was performed on the data set to discover and find trends within the data. Ultimately views were created for the number of electric vehicles per year, the location of these electric vehicles, their average range, their base MSRP and their CAFV eligibility. Those tables were then passed onto Tableau where the visualizations were created.

The second portion of this project was done using Tableau. The interactive Tableau dashboard can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/views/EVDashboard_17471634070060/EVDashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

By exploring the visualization and toggling the filters we can draw 5 major conclusions:
- While the number of EVs has steadily increased over time, 2023 had the most new electric vehicles
- There are significantly more battery electric vehicles compared to plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
- The area with the most electric vehicles was around Seattle, which seems to be correlated with population density
- Since 2011, the average range of battery electric vehicles has steadily increased while the average range of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles has stayed relatively the same
- Overall base MSRP of EVs has steadily declined since 2008
